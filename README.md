# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development-I

Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
 -Angular’s project structure (SPA) is different from Express’s HTML customer-facing page. Angular uses HTML to make the app's interface, while Express procedurally defines it in JavaScript. HTML is more easy to manipulate and change than JavaScript. With Express, there is much more involvement with the flow of the program and how things should be loaded, while with Angular, the specifics are handled automatically. 
 -Some of the advantages of SPA functionality is loading times, the user experience, and the caching capabilities, but there are security issues and it needs more resources from the browser. It also only has a single URL, which causes loads of issues for sharing anything. SPA is also more difficult to upgrade as well. 
 -Some additional functionality of SPA is that it loads everything in a single page, so it is faster. It is also simple and effective since it remains on the one page. Everything is in the browser, so it is faster because of that too, and it can be used separately from a server in certain use cases for periods of time.
 -Javascript is everywhere. It is lightweight, installed on basically every modern browser, and is used in mobile app development, games, and more. It is quick and efficient. Once you know Javascript, you basically know a lot of the other offshoots of it and should be well prepared.


Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  -Backends use a NoSQL MongoDB database because there is a limited amout of space that you can use on just a web browser. There has to be some place for all the data to connect back up, and that is the MongoDB database. It is also easily scalable and easily manageable.


Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  - JSON is a way in which data is formatted and is read by Javascript to make an object in Javascript. This allows that frontend and the backend to be tied together since there is both a way to create and store these JSON objects easily. It allows it to be used in a bunch of ways and allows it to be versatile.


Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  - Some of the refactored code used in the full stack process is when I added functionality to create, delete, update, and store Trips on the fly. By allowing the user to do this on the browser, it gives a better UI experience. I was also able to incorporate security into these UI elements without any sort of issue because of the reusable UI components used in the full stack process.



Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.
Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  - Some methods to request and retrieve API endpoints is GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. All of these functions are used in the database in order to modify it when necessary. Endpoints need to be tested to ensure that they show the proper UI when used. Security can be tested by only allowing certain endpoints to be used when there is authentication of some sort. From there, you can test the security since it otherwise wouldn't appear or be usable.



Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  - Considering that I knew nothing of the full stack process before, this class has taught me quite a lot. I have learned a lot about HTML and how to develop endpoints and implement features in a full stack environment. Since this website was built by me (albeit through the instruction of the class), I feel that the skill to implement and understand the process will be marketable in the future.
